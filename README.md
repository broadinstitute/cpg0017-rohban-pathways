# Image-based Profiles

Made from images intially described in [Rohban et al., 2017](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/092403v1).
Images were reprocessed with [updated pipelines](https://github.com/broadinstitute/imaging-platform-pipelines/tree/master/JUMP_production) and new profiles were generated with this template.
The full dataset can be found in the [cellpainting-gallery on RODA](https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery).

# Image-based Profiling Template

This repository was derived from a [template repository](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) located at https://github.com/cytomining/profiling-template.
The purpose of the repository is to weld together a versioned data processing pipeline with versioned processed output data for a single image-based profiling experiment.
